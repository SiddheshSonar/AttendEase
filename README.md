AttendEase is a modern method of capturing attendance. It is a bluetooth based attendance system running majorly off mobile devices with minimal backend and database requirements. It includes a mobile application along with a web console, built completely using open-source frameworks and tools to replace the already existing presence detection methods. AttendEase at its core relies on Bluetooth LE, which is a standard in smartphones that dates back 5 to 8 years.
